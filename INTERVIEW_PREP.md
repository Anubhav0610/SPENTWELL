## Tech Stack Deep Dive

### Frontend Technologies

#### 1. React 18.3.1
**What it is**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
**Why we used it**: 
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Virtual DOM for performance
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Hooks for cleaner state management

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: Why React over other frameworks?
- A: React provides flexibility, has massive community support, and integrates well with TypeScript. Its component model makes the codebase maintainable and testable.

- Q: Explain how you optimized React performance
- A: Used React.memo for expensive components, custom hooks to avoid prop drilling, and React Router's lazy loading for code splitting

- Q: What are React hooks you used?
- A: useState, useEffect, custom hooks (useAuth, useBudget), useCallback for memoization, and useNavigate for routing

#### 2. TypeScript
**What it is**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript
**Why we used it**:
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE autocomplete and refactoring
- Self-documenting code with interfaces
- Safer refactoring

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: Benefits of TypeScript?
- A: Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves developer experience with autocomplete, makes refactoring safer, and serves as inline documentation

- Q: Show an example of TypeScript in your project
```typescript
interface StatsGridProps {
  totalExpenses: number;
  budget: number;
  transactionCount: number;
}
```
- A: This interface ensures components receive correct prop types, preventing bugs

#### 3. Tailwind CSS
**What it is**: Utility-first CSS framework
**Why we used it**:
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Small bundle size with purging
- No CSS naming conflicts

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: Why Tailwind over traditional CSS?
- A: Faster development, no naming conflicts, responsive design built-in, and easy to maintain consistent design system. Used custom design tokens for colors and spacing.

- Q: How did you handle the design system?
- A: Created semantic color tokens in index.css using CSS variables, configured in tailwind.config.ts, used HSL colors for dark mode support

#### 4. Vite
**What it is**: Modern build tool and dev server
**Why we used it**:
- Extremely fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Native ES modules in development
- Optimized production builds
- Better than Webpack for React apps

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: What's the difference between Vite and Webpack?
- A: Vite uses native ES modules in dev for instant server start and fast HMR. Webpack bundles everything. Vite is significantly faster for development.

### Backend Technologies

#### 5. Supabase (Lovable Cloud)
**What it is**: Open-source Firebase alternative with PostgreSQL
**Why we used it**:
- Full PostgreSQL database
- Built-in authentication
- Row Level Security for multi-tenancy
- Real-time subscriptions
- Edge Functions for serverless logic

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: Why Supabase over Firebase?
- A: Supabase uses PostgreSQL (SQL) which is more powerful and familiar than Firestore (NoSQL). Better for complex queries, joins, and transactions. Also open-source.

- Q: Explain Row Level Security
- A: RLS allows policies to be set at database level to restrict data access. Each user can only see their own expenses/budgets based on user_id matching auth.uid()

Example policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own expenses"
ON expenses FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

- Q: How did you handle real-time updates?
- A: Used Supabase real-time subscriptions to listen for database changes, automatically updating UI when transactions are added/updated

#### 6. PostgreSQL
**What it is**: Powerful open-source relational database
**Why we used it**:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Triggers and functions
- JSON support for flexible data

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: How did you design the database schema?
- A: Normalized design with separate tables for expenses, budgets, and savings_goals. Each has user_id foreign key. Used proper indexes on frequently queried columns.

- Q: Explain a complex query you wrote
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(amount) as total
FROM expenses
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND date >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total DESC;
```
- A: This aggregates current month's expenses by category, filtered by user, for the spending breakdown chart

#### 7. Edge Functions (Deno)
**What it is**: Serverless functions running on the edge
**Why we used it**:
- Low latency (runs close to users)
- Secure backend logic
- Protect API keys
- Handle AI requests

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: Why use edge functions?
- A: Keep API keys secure on backend, add server-side validation, handle rate limiting, and reduce latency by running close to users

- Q: How did you handle AI streaming?
- A: Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) parser that processes AI responses line-by-line, handling partial JSON and flushing buffers properly

### AI Integration

#### 8. Lovable AI Gateway (Gemini 2.5)
**What it is**: AI model gateway providing access to Google Gemini
**Why we used it**:
- No API key management needed
- Pre-configured in backend
- Cost-effective
- Good balance of speed and quality

**Interview Questions**:
- Q: How did you integrate AI?
- A: Built edge function that proxies requests to Lovable AI Gateway, streaming responses back to client using SSE. Added proper error handling for rate limits (429) and payment issues (402)

- Q: Why streaming instead of waiting for full response?
- A: Better UX - users see responses appear in real-time like ChatGPT. Implemented token-by-token rendering by parsing SSE events progressively

- Q: What challenges did you face with AI?
- A: Handling partial JSON responses across network chunks, managing buffer state, detecting [DONE] signals, and providing good error messages when rate limited

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture
**Decision**: Small, focused components with single responsibility
**Reasoning**: 
- Easier to test and maintain
- Promotes reusability
- Clear separation of concerns

**Example**:
- `StatsGrid.tsx` - Only handles stat cards display
- `DashboardHeader.tsx` - Only header with user info
- `ModalContainer.tsx` - Reusable modal wrapper

### 2. State Management
**Decision**: Mix of local state, custom hooks, and Supabase for server state
**Reasoning**:
- Local state for UI-only concerns (modals, forms)
- Custom hooks for shared logic (useAuth, useBudget)
- Supabase handles server state with real-time sync

**No Redux needed** because:
- Supabase handles most global state
- Component tree isn't deep enough to need context
- Custom hooks provide sufficient state sharing

### 3. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Email-based auth with Supabase, auto-confirm enabled
**Reasoning**:
- Simple user onboarding
- Secure with Supabase's auth system
- RLS automatically handles user isolation
- No need for email verification in development

### 4. Data Visualization
**Decision**: Recharts library
**Reasoning**:
- React-native charts
- Responsive out of box
- Good TypeScript support
- Flexible customization

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chart.js - not React-friendly
- D3.js - too complex for needs
- Victory - larger bundle size

### 5. Styling Approach
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
**Reasoning**:
- Rapid development
- Consistent spacing/colors
- Easy responsive design
- Small bundle with purging

**Design system includes**:
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent)
- Consistent shadows and animations
- Responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode support

## Common Interview Questions

### General Project Questions

**Q: Walk me through your project**
A: It's a personal finance tracker where users can log expenses, set budgets, track savings goals, calculate debt payoff plans, and chat with an AI for financial advice. Built with React and Supabase, fully responsive, with real-time data sync.

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
A: Implementing AI streaming with proper error handling. Had to parse Server-Sent Events line-by-line, handle partial JSON, manage buffer state, and gracefully handle rate limits. Required understanding of streams and careful state management.

1. Sort debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Pay minimum on all debts
3. Put extra payment toward highest-interest debt
4. When paid off, move to next highest
5. Calculate month-by-month: payment, interest, principal, remaining balance
6. Sum total interest and time to payoff

**Q: How do you handle security?**
A:
1. Row Level Security policies on all tables
2. API keys stored in backend (not exposed to client)
3. Input validation on client and server
4. SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
5. XSS prevention (React escapes by default)
6. CORS properly configured
7. HTTPS only in production

**Q: Explain your component structure**
A:
```
Dashboard (page)
├── DashboardHeader (user info, logout)
├── StatsGrid (4 stat cards)
├── SpendingChart (pie/bar visualization)
├── RecentTransactions (list with filters)
├── QuickActionsCard (buttons to open modals)
├── SavingsGoals (goal tracker)
└── ModalContainer (wraps forms)
    ├── ExpenseForm
    ├── BudgetForm
    ├── AIGuide
    └── DebtCalculator
```

**Q: How do you handle API errors?**
A:
1. Try-catch blocks around async operations
2. Display user-friendly error messages with toast notifications
3. Log errors to console for debugging
4. Handle specific errors (404, 429, 402) differently
5. Provide fallback UI states
6. Retry logic for transient failures

**Q: Describe your development workflow**
A:
1. Built with Lovable (AI-powered development platform)
2. Git for version control
3. Feature branch workflow
4. Real-time preview during development
5. TypeScript for compile-time errors
6. ESLint for code quality
7. Manual testing across devices

### Behavioral Questions

**Q: Tell me about a bug you fixed**
A: Initially the spending chart wasn't showing data. Discovered that the data aggregation was grouping by category correctly but not formatting for Recharts. Added proper data transformation to convert from object to array format with explicit color fields. Learned importance of understanding library data requirements.

**Q: How do you learn new technologies?**
A: For this project, learned Supabase and Edge Functions by reading official docs, following tutorials, and building incrementally. Started with simple CRUD, then added auth, RLS, and finally Edge Functions. Learning by building real features is most effective for me.

**Q: How do you handle disagreement with design decisions?**
A: I'd present data-backed alternatives (performance benchmarks, user research, technical constraints) but ultimately defer to product/design team. As a developer, my role is to provide technical perspective while respecting design expertise.

## Practice Demo Script

"Hi, let me show you my personal finance tracker. [Login] Here's the dashboard - it shows total spent, budget left, number of transactions, and average per day. This pie chart breaks down spending by category in real-time. 

[Click Add Expense] I can add a new expense with title, amount, category, and date. [Submit] Notice it instantly updates the stats and chart - that's Supabase real-time sync.

[Click AI Guide] This AI assistant uses Google's Gemini model. I can ask for financial advice. [Type question] Watch how it streams the response token-by-token for better UX - I implemented SSE parsing on the backend.

[Click Debt Calculator] This calculates optimal debt payoff using the avalanche method. [Add debts] It shows total interest saved and creates a month-by-month payment plan.

[Click Savings Goals] Users can set financial goals and track progress. It calculates how much they need to save monthly and what they can spend while still hitting their target.

The entire stack is React, TypeScript, and Supabase with PostgreSQL. Everything is secured with Row Level Security so users only see their own data. The UI is fully responsive and works great on mobile."
